## Prompt

I have a set of real lab pictures with millimeter graph paper in background and I want do define and develop enhancement pipeline. Assume the actual background paper has white color and the lighting is suboptimal (not enough light). I need recipes and optimal order for these tasks:

- assess the amounts of various standard noise types and apply automatic denoising
- adust brightness, perhaps curves by setting white point to lighter regions of paper, which also needs to be identified.

Perhaps, a more interesting objective is to assess geometric distortions by looking at the grids. Can I identify grids via fft/wavelet? Can I estimate parameters for reversing rotated camera view (all three axes) and pinhole camera distortions by analyzing spatial grid info?

My guess I will need OpenCV, skimage, what else?

## Response

Below is a **complete, engineer-level recipe** for building an enhancement + camera-geometry assessment pipeline **specifically for real lab photographs with millimeter graph paper**, where **paper is white with faint grid** and **lighting is suboptimal**.

This is written as a **design document** with reasoning, processing order, and concrete algorithms / library choices.

# ✅ 0. Recommended Libraries

You'll need:

### **Core**

- **OpenCV** (`cv2`) → filtering, geometry, camera models
- **scikit-image** → denoising, exposure, FFT tools
- **NumPy**, **SciPy (fft, ndimage)** → FFT & correlation
- **OpenCV contrib** (optional) → better calibration
- **pywavelets** → wavelet-based grid detection

### **Optional / advanced**

- **imreg_dft** → robust sub-pixel registration and affine detection via FFT
- **OpenCV ArUco/Charuco** if you add manual calibration markers

---

# ✅ 1. Pipeline Overview (Optimal Order)

This is the recommended full pipeline:

1. **RAW input (BGR/RAW/PNG)**
2. **White region detection → estimate “paper whiteness”**
3. **Exposure correction**
    - White-point correction based on paper
    - Gamma / curve adjustment
4. **Noise estimation (quantify each noise type)**
    - Gaussian, shot noise, salt-pepper
    - Then **auto-denoising** using best model
5. **Grid extraction & enhancement**
    - FFT or wavelets to identify grid frequencies
    - Extract grid lines (major + minor, depending on paper)
6. **Geometric distortion estimation**
    1. **Perspective / camera orientation (3 DOF)**
    2. **Skew / affine distortions**
    3. **Lens distortion params (k₁, k₂, p₁, p₂)**
7. **Back-projective correction**
    - Remove perspective
    - Remove radial distortion
8. **Quality check & refine**

# 🔧 2. Lighting & Exposure Correction

## **2.1 Detect the “white paper” baseline**

Your background graph paper _is_ your calibration target.

### Strategy:

1. Apply a **large Gaussian blur** → smooth out grid lines:

```python
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (51, 51), 0)
```

2. Compute the **top N% brightest pixels** → these approximate paper.    
3. Use **95–98th percentile** of blurred grayscale as white point estimate.

Or use skimage:

```python
from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu
val = threshold_otsu(blurred_gray)
```

**Result:**  
You get estimated paper white color → `(W_R, W_G, W_B)`.

### White-point correction:

Use **Gray World** or **White Patch** algorithm:

```python
scales = target_white / measured_white
img_corr = img * scales
```

### Remove uneven illumination:

Use **Retinex** (skimage works well):

```python
from skimage.restoration import denoise_bilateral
illum = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (101,101),0)
corrected = gray / (illum + eps)
```

# 🔧 3. Noise Estimation + Denoising

## **3.1 Automatically Estimate Noise**

Use:

### Gaussian noise estimate

- skimage: `estimate_sigma(image, multichannel=True)`
- wavelet-based: PyWavelets variance in HH subbands

### Shot noise (Poisson)

- Check relationship between mean and variance locally:  
    If var ≈ mean → Poisson-like.

### Salt & pepper

- Measure pixel impulse proportion using  
    `np.count_nonzero((img < t1) | (img > t2)) / total`.    

---

## **3.2 Apply the right denoiser**

|Noise type|Best denoiser|
|---|---|
|Gaussian|**Non-local Means**, **BM3D**, CV’s `fastNlMeansDenoisingColored`|
|Poisson|**Wavelet shrinkage**, **Anscombe transform → BM3D**|
|Mixed|**skimage “denoise_nl_means”** or **CV bilateral filter**|

Recommendation:

```python
from skimage.restoration import denoise_nl_means, estimate_sigma
sigma = estimate_sigma(img, channel_axis=-1)
den = denoise_nl_means(img, h=1.2*sigma, patch_size=7, patch_distance=9)
```

# 🔧 4. Grid Detection (FFT/Wavelet)

Your graph paper is periodic → perfect for frequency analysis.

## **4.1 FFT method**

1. Convert to grayscale
2. FFT → magnitude spectrum
3. Detect **strong peaks** away from DC.  
    There will be **4 dominant peaks** (two axes × ±).

Grid frequency `fx, fy` is given by peak locations.

### From FFT peaks you get:

- Grid spacing (mm to pixel scale)
- Rotation angle of camera (2D rotation)
- Perspective shear (peak asymmetry)
- Local warping (if peaks are broadened)

FFT is excellent for:
- Dense minor grids (1 mm)
- Major grids (5–10 mm)

## **4.2 Wavelet method**

Using 2D wavelet transforms:
- CWT ridge detection → grid lines
- Use directional wavelets (Morlet/Pauli) to detect line orientation

Wavelet method is excellent for:
- Uneven lighting
- Partial occlusion
- Low contrast grids

# 🎯 5. Geometric Distortion Estimation

This is the key part if you want **camera pose** and **lens distortion**.

## ✔ 5.1 Perspective + Camera Rotation

Grid lines should be **parallel**, but under perspective they converge.

### How to estimate:

- Extract grid lines via Sobel/Canny → Hough transform → detect line families
- Two line families → compute vanishing points:
    - Intersection of horizontal lines → VP₁
    - Intersection of vertical lines → VP₂
- Third vanishing point is either inferable (orthogonality assumption) or unnecessary.

### From VPs:

- Recover camera yaw, pitch, roll
- Estimate homography H mapping image → canonical grid

OpenCV:

```python
H, _ = cv2.findHomography(src_grid_points, dst_ideal_points)
```

---

## ✔ 5.2 Radial Lens Distortion (k₁, k₂, p₁, p₂)

Radial distortion makes straight grid lines **curve**.

### Approach:

1. Use extracted grid lines
2. Fit curves (splines)
3. Estimate distortion by matching curved lines to ideal straight lines.

OpenCV supports this:

```python
camera_matrix, dist_coeffs = cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, ...)
```

You can provide:

- objpoints: ideal grid (mm scale)
- imgpoints: detected intersections (via FFT/Hough)

Even without calibration pattern, grid lines from paper serve as a _pseudo-calibration target_.

---

## ✔ 5.3 Correct order:

1. Estimate & remove ISS:
    - Radial distortion first
    - Then perspective (homography)
    - Then affine corrections
2. Confirm grid lines become straight.

---

# 🔧 6. Back-Projection & Image Correction

### Step 1: Undistort radial lens

```python
undist = cv2.undistort(img, camera_matrix, dist_coeffs)
```

### Step 2: Perspective correction (rectify the paper)

```python
flat = cv2.warpPerspective(undist, H, output_size)
```

After this the grid should appear straight and equally spaced.

# 🔍 7. Final enhancements (optional)

- Local contrast enhancement (CLAHE)
- Sharpening only after full denoise/dewarp
- Extract object boundaries on the grid

---

# 🧩 8. Practical Notes for Lab Picture Use-Case

### **What the grid gives you:**

- Perfect periodic frequency structure → FFT friendly
- Perfect rectilinear geometry → camera calibration friendly
- Known metric spacing (1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm) → scale calibration

### **Best feature extractor for intersections**

- Harris with subpixel refinement
- ORB corners (fast)
- Peaks in distance transform from primary grid lines

### **Avoid pitfalls**

- Uneven lighting → kills FFT → apply illumination correction first
- Over-denoising → destroys faint grid lines  
    → denoise _after_ exposure correction but _before_ FFT
- Too strong CLAHE → will artificially strengthen noise  
    → apply conservatively or after rectification

# 📦 9. Minimal Working Pipeline (Pseudo-Code)

```python
img = load_image()

# 1. White paper detection & brightness correction
white_estimate = estimate_paper_white(img)
img = white_balance(img, white_estimate)
img = illumination_correct(img)

# 2. Noise estimation + denoise
sigma = estimate_sigma(img)
img = denoise_nl_means(img, h=1.2*sigma)

# 3. Extract grid via FFT
fx, fy, angle = detect_grid_fft(img)
grid_lines = extract_grid_lines(img)

# 4. Compute vanishing points & perspective
Vp1, Vp2 = compute_vanishing_points(grid_lines)
H = compute_homography_from_vps(Vp1, Vp2)

# 5. Estimate distortion
camera_matrix, dist_coeffs = estimate_lens_distortion(grid_lines)

# 6. Correct geometry
img = cv2.undistort(img, camera_matrix, dist_coeffs)
img = cv2.warpPerspective(img, H)

# 7. Final enhancement
img = apply_clahe(img)
```
